# Ask Nasa

This was a solo project in CodeCool's Frontend Developer course.

This one of first big projects which had to be created by React. I couldn't care about the design, because I received some order, which showed me how should this application be look like.

So according to the task, using a NASA API key I had to create an image gallery. There should be a home page and a unique page for each picture with some written data. The trick was the NASA sometimes uploads videos instead of pictures, so I had to find out a solution for this. At this point of my studies I still didn't know about React Router, with that it would have been much easier but I still was able to solve the page changing problem with useState.

As I mentioned, this project was made with React with an API key, but I uploaded this work without the key because of the rules. It's not hard to ask a new API key on the NASA's webpage. After you received your own key, paste it in the "gallery.js" in the "YOUR_API_KEY",	make and 'npm install' in the terminal, than 'npm start' and you're good to go.
